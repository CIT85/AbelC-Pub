<h1>
<strong>Goals of Mine</strong> </h1>
<br>
Some goals of mine I plan to complete through life while I am here consists of family, money, and happiness. 
I want a family, I have my family I came from, but having my own kids and wife is something I desire in life.
I want to get out of debt, not only just that but get my parents out of debt, one of the things I want to do most that I'm closest to accomplishing is being the first person in my family to compelte college, although it is a city college and I plan to transfer to a University after, being the first and currently only one in my family is something I want to do most and that I hopefully can do next after next semester.
<br>
<br>

Also another goal of mine is finishing my car by the end of 2024, I still have plans to bag it, swap engine and transmission, exhaust and installing a new car system. My car's name is Patricia and here she is below so beautiful.
