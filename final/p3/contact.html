<h1>Fun Fact</h1>

    <p>Ok so something about me really quickly a little fun fact, when I was two years old I was attacked by my dog and it bite me on the head and from what my mother claims I should have died with the amount of blood I was losing. I had to get surgery when I was two year that required 74 stitches, and the hospital ran out of stitches and had to apply a additional 62 staples for my injury.</p>
