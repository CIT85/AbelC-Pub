<h4>Story Time</h4>
    
    <p>Growing up I never really had the shoes I wanted, it was more of what my parents could afford which I was very grateful for. I do have alot of shoes that you can refer over to <a href="personalshoes.html">Personal Shoes</a> you will see that there. Growing up I wasn't the biggest sneaker head but my appericate for shoes grew after my first air forces I got when I was 16, and since then I always have some fresh ones, now the list below is going to be my all time favorites some I own and some I do not.<strong> ENJOY!!!! </strong></p>
