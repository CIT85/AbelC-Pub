            <h2>Most Expensive Shoes Sold</h2>
            <p>We all heard of shoes going for 50$, 100$, and even thousands of dollars. But what if I told you the most expensive shoe sold isn't even in the 1 million mark. The most expensive shoes sold were the Jordan 13s Bred, better known as the last dance kicks from MJ worn during the 1998 NBA Finals where MJ took home his final and 6th ring. They sold at auction for 2.2 million dollars.</p>
