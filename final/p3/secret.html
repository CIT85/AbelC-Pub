    <h1>Welcome to my secret page!</h1></header>

    <p class="bordered-paragraph">If you have made it this far it seems like you have found my secret page and I need to turn and run. Haha, this class has been very fun and a bit challenging for me but I can say I will walk out here with new knowledge and skills when it comes to HTML and CSS. Since I built a website with pages based on shoes, It has finally come for me to show my own show collection. I have a total of 18 pairs of shoes so far,I have my basketball pair I keep in my car whenever I play, those are some Air Jordan 11 Concord Breds and two sandals I did not include. I plan to get alot more shoes in the future, but I have recently ran out of room in my current shoe shelve, that only holds 15 so I need to get a bigger one or additional ones I can put on my wall or something. </p>
